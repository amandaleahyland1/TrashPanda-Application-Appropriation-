TrashPandas – Job Application Package Builder (Offline Bundle)
============================================================

Files:
- index.html (open this)
- assets/animations/* (required)

Quick Start (Android tablet/phone with OTG flash drive):
1) Plug in the flash drive via OTG adapter.
2) Open a File Manager app.
3) Navigate to this folder and tap index.html.

Notes:
- The app still requires internet to call the Gemini API.
- Some mobile browsers restrict advanced features when opened via file://.
  If something doesn’t work, use the 'Local Server' option below.

Local Server option (most reliable):
Android (Termux):
  pkg update && pkg install python
  cd <this-folder>
  python -m http.server 8000
  Open browser to: http://127.0.0.1:8000

iPhone/iPad:
  iOS often blocks file:// web apps. Use hosting (Netlify) or a local-server app.
